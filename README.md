# Hi there, I'm Thomas Jamais 👋

## 💼 Senior Backend Developer (Node.js / TypeScript)

I'm a senior backend-focused developer with 7+ years of professional experience building scalable web platforms and distributed systems.

I primarily work with Node.js and TypeScript, with solid experience designing APIs, microservices, and data pipelines. Over the years, I have contributed to and led parts of transitions from monolithic architectures to event-driven microservices in production environments.

I enjoy working on technically challenging products, especially around finance, data, and real-time systems. Recently, I have also been exploring Web3 ecosystems through personal projects.
